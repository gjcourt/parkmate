Parkmate
========

--------

The idea of this project is to avoid having to pay silly fines simply because
we can be forgetful. The sole purpose of this sight is to remind you to move
your car before you get a ticket.

Since there are already a number of ways to keep track of short amounts of
time, for say parking meters, the target audience of parkmate is the
universe of people that are paranoid about getting a street cleaning or
towing ticket. The expected time to move your car for this class of incident
can vary anywhere between a few days to a few weeks. If this is a problem
for you, parkmate will hopefully solve it.

The Parkmate application is written in clojure. We are currently using a
few super cool libraries to help us get off the ground. These include
[moustache](http://github.com/cgrand/moustache),
[enlive](http://github.com/cgrand/enlive), and
[ring](http://github.com/ring-clojure/ring). All of these
libraries are useful, intuitive, and relatively light-weight.

The website is built using html/js/css using
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) (isn't
everything these days) which removes almost all of the pain associated with
front-end development.

As of right now, the project is a WIP, but we're expecting to at least keep
going until we reach an MVP. We'll keep you posted :]
