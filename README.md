Parkmate
========

--------

The sole purpose of this site is to remind you to move your car before you
get a ticket. The future home of this project will be http://parkmate.us
but until the code is deployable it will live in this repo.

Since there are already a number of ways to keep track of short amounts of
time, for say parking meters, the target audience of Parkmate is the
universe of people that are paranoid about getting a street cleaning or
towing ticket. The expected time to move your car for this class of incident
can vary anywhere between a few days to a few weeks. If this is a problem
for you, Parkmate will hopefully solve it.

The Parkmate application is written in clojure. We are currently using a
few super cool libraries to help us get off the ground. These include
[moustache](http://github.com/cgrand/moustache),
[enlive](http://github.com/cgrand/enlive), and
[ring](http://github.com/ring-clojure/ring). All of these
libraries are useful, intuitive, and relatively light-weight.

The website is built using
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) (isn't
everything these days) which removes almost all of the pain associated with
front-end development.

As of right now, the project is a WIP, but we're expecting to at least keep
going until we reach an MVP. We'll keep you posted :]
